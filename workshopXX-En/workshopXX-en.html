# Workshop 11: Simulations in R
## QCBSx R Workshop Series <br> x = independent
### Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science

---




&lt;!-- How this workshop started (or what prompted the original development of this workshop)
I was reading R. Dawkins (Climbing Mount Improbable) and Futuyma's Evolution book and wanted to understand deeply what was going on when the authors were talking about a specific topic. So I started to simulate some of the ideas in the books. 

That got me interested to know what was available in R to do simulations. So I started reading on the subject and found it very relevant for graduate students and for scientists. So I wanted to develop a workshop that would enable graduate students to be more proficient in performing simulations. I hope that this workshop could be of any use to the people that are studying it. 
--&gt;

&lt;!-- Ideas on how to present 
It was proposed that this workshop could be recorded (with or without an audience) in small chunks so that people can refer to the parts that are less clear (at their own pace)

--&gt;

# Disclaimer

- I am not a statistician and do not pretend to fully understand all the implications of what will be presented. 
- In addition, this is a work in progress. Any input you have is more than welcome.

???
This workshop was designed to give you the tools to perform simulations in R. 
- Simulations to get data in order to perform a statistical model, 
- but also to be able to simulate a situation and verify how a parameter change the outcome of a model. 
- Go see the [Simulation in R Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11bNgLUCyvlL8Ndq_nF-N6T71dZwgETbhbSHuc40VqvU/edit#slide=id.p) here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11bNgLUCyvlL8Ndq_nF-N6T71dZwgETbhbSHuc40VqvU/edit#slide=id.p

---
# Prerequisites
&lt;!-- I will be using base plot for this workshop: this is because it is MUCH EASIER to get quick BEAUTIFUL plots and show stuff --&gt;
For this workshop it is useful to have a solid understanding of 

1. Linear models and generalized linear models (GLMs)
2. Programming in R 

See the [QCBS R workshops](https://r.qcbs.ca/) if you want to revise these topics. Select the [R workshops](http://r.qcbs.ca/workshops/) needed.

- We are going to review some aspects of these workshops, but getting some experience from those subjects can clearly help you for this workshop. 
- We are going to be more explicitly show assumptions of models and use for loops in this workshop 

???

- This workshop builds on the previous workshops. 
- But don't worry, we are going to refresh some of the concepts here. 


---
# Learning objectives

1. Develop intuition and skills to perform simulations
2. Explore useful functions when designing simulations 
3. Articulate what are the assumptions underlying a simulation (for the models tested or the scope of the simulation)
4. Know how and when to use important statistical distributions
5. Simulate different data structure to perform LMs, GLMs, and (G)LMMs. 

???

Hopefully, this is what people will get out of this workshop.

In this section, we will explore 
- What are simulations 
- What is the idea behind simulations
- What statistics has to do with simulations.
- Understand, with all of these, wy simulations are relevant.

# Background and questions

- Have you ever performed a simulation in R?
- What are simulations for? Would simulations be useful for your current or future work? 
- Why do you think they are important? 
- When do you think they are helpful? 
- What is a model? Can you give examples of models that are not statistical models? 
???
- Have you ever performed a simulation in R?  Elsewhere? 
- What are simulations for? Would simulations be useful for your current or future work? 
- Why do you think they are important? 
- When do you think they are helpful? 
- **What is a model?** Can you give examples of models that are not statistical models? 
  * It's an **imitation of a structure, machine, etc.** showing **relevant** parts (usually smaller or simplified).
  * examples such as 
    - a **cell model** (like the plastic stuff you' have'd find in a lab)
    - The atomic model 
    - A **map** (which is a **representation of our world** to NAVIGATE in it)
      * they are abstractions of the real world (It is not the real world) 
      * The only map that is right is the 1:1 real map which would not be useful to make a sense of how the world is. Imagine that to go to the pharmacy, I need to give you all the genetic sequences of the trees that you encounter to get the directions. This would be insane! Therefore, we **simplify** and just extract what is useful for a particular situation. 
    - Basically our task is to take **statistical Clay and model it** as we wish based on some idea. In this workshop, I want you to be able to play a bit more with statistical plasticine. "Pâte à modelée" (Plasticine, Play-Doh)

    - The goal is to make part of our world easier to understand, define, quantify, vizualize, simulate, etc. See [Scientific modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling)

# Defining simulations

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

.center[
"[...] the term 'simulation' describes a wealth of varied and useful techniques, all connected with the mimicking of the rules of a model of some kind."
]

.right[— Byron J. T. Morgan 1984]

???

- Simulations are made in different flavors, via 
  * physical reproductions at smaller scale or 
  * mathematical models in computer (*in silico*)
- See [Beginner’s Guide to Simulating Data](http://www.page-gould.com/simulation/Guide-to-Simulation-for-R.html)

# Usefulness of models

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

.center[
"Models can help to guide a scientist's intuition about how various processes interact; they can point out logical flaws in an argument; they can identify testable hypotheses, generate key predictions, and suggest appropriate experiments; and they can reshape fields by providing new ways of thinking about a problem. But mathematical models also have their limitations. The results of an analysis are only as interesting as the biological questions motivating a model. [...]"
]

- "Science will progress faster and further by a marriage of mathematical and empirical biology. This marriage will be even more successful if more biologists can use math, when needed, to advance their own research goals. It is toward this end that we devote this book." — Sarah. P. Otto, and Troy Day 2007
- [All models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) "The aphorism is generally attributed to the statistician George Box, although the underlying concept predates Box's writings." "Box, George E. P. (1976), "Science and statistics" (PDF), Journal of the American Statistical Association, 71 (356): 791–799, doi:10.1080/01621459.1976.10480949."
- But it would be very unproductive to say that all maps are wrong. They are still very useful!

# Simulations are games 

- Simulations are games where we make up the rules
- Simulations are powerful tool that can generate 'alternative worlds'. 
- We are responsible and need to take conscious choices in order to get an answer (and we sometimes need to make a lot of choices). 
- One of the challenges in this game is to figure out what the parameters are (or the rules) for the processes that make up the natural world. 


.alert[Are these two distribution showing the same random process? ] 
&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/normal_compare_theoretical_simulated-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

**Games**: 
- Basically, we want to play with numbers within a particular set of rules in order to see if we can understand the behaviour of those numbers within the set of rules. 
- We need to find a **strategy** in order to play the game properly. 
- What is the goal of the game? We want to understand the natural world 

**responsible and need to take conscious choices [...]**
- When we design a simulation, we have to build in the **assumptions of the models** or the **processes** we are trying to recreate. 
- So we need to **decide** (or plan), what is going to make up the process. 
- The *parameters and variable are chosen by you*
  * They need to be plausible (look into literature, ask a colleague for data already collected).
- In a nutshell, you need to be **statistically aware** of what you are modeling and what you want to know. 


**IMAGE**: Are these two distribution showing the same *random process*?
- Yes! They are both normally distributed 
  * **left**: standard normal curve and 
  * **right**: density plot of 6 pts randomly drawn from a normal distribution
  * BUT, they are NOT identical. The SAME RULES are generating the 2 distributions, but they are NOT showing the same curves...

- Like Étienne Low-Décarie said it "it eliminates the need for dice when playing Dungeons and Dragons"
```
library(TeachingDemos)
dice(rolls=3, ndice=4, sides=6, plot.it=T,
     load=rep(1, 6))
```

# Find patterns in random processes

- Simulations are useful to test the properties of randomly generated data 
- Since we design the simulation, we know the parameters of the processes.
???
You probably learned how to use statistical models on certain types of data. 
- In order to answer your research question, you need to collect data. 
- We then have an a posteriori understanding of the parameters that make up the phenomenon we are interested in. 
- Simulations help you, 
  * bypass the requirement of data, AND
  * Let you SET the exact parameters you think are relevant for the pattern you want to characterize (perhaps based on the literature on a subject.)
  * **CAREFUL**! Do not simulate data to generate **FAKE** data. 
--

- It is then possible to test various methods or statistical analysis to 
    1. see if they work and verify their assumptions, 
    2. do [power analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html) and dry run [an experimental design](https://low-decarie.github.io/Introduction-to-simulation-for-experimental-design-using-R/#/),
    3. learn how data is generated,
    4. prepare your analysis script before data collection (or preregistration),
    5. understand and "see" what a model or equation predicts,
    6. [give you teaching material](https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/datasim//examples.html), 
    7. explore ideas, theories, hypothesis, the existence of a phenomenon or a slow process,
    8. simulate tragic events to see their impact (e.g., nuclear explosion, flood, emergence and trajectories of hurricanes, etc.) 
    9. etc. 
???
- Forest management: could be long to get data: simulations can help to take faster decision
- Epidemics, road congestion, simulate tragic events to see their impact (e.g., nuclear explosion, flood, emergence of hurricane, etc.)
- See book Morgan, B.J.T., 1984. Elements of simulation, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.

# Find patterns in the natural world

- We might start with a research question or simply want to understand a process.
- We might be interested in understanding how a certain process was generated 
  * how `\(X\)` influences `\(Y\)`, which could be written as `\(X \xrightarrow{Affects} Y\)` or `\(Y \sim X\)`. 

&lt;br&gt;

- This is probably the most important points for simulations in biology:
  * We are trying to understand **natural processes**, which are themselves manifestations of **random processes** or **stochastic process**
- Therefore, being able to do simulations can be a nice addition to your research toolkit. 

???

Everything that we measure is caused by factors that scientists try to make sense. 
- e.g. a phenotype, the number of eggs birds lay in a population, the survival of individuals in a population, or other ecological (and environmental) variables, etc.
- The question here is: 
  * **How these measures came to be**? 
  * What process governs the value that we measured? 
  * In other words, 
     1. How is the data that I've measured distributed? and 
     2. What causes my data to be distributed that way?

- Random ([stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process)) process
  * Collection of random variables defined by some parameters
  * E.g., bacterial growth: you can probably not predict exactly the exact time when a single bacterium will divide, but over a certain amount of time, you might get an idea of the rate at which bacteria divide and colonize a petri dish. 

For power analysis...
- See also `power.prop.test()`

# Probability distributions are crucial for simulations

- When performing simulations, one has to keep in mind the
  1. **type of distribution** underlying the data of interest
  2. **parameters** of the distribution itself (mean, standard deviation, rate, degrees of freedom, etc.)
  3. **statistical model** making the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable. 
  4. ideas or things we *want to show or learn* with the simulation
???
- That might not apply to all sorts of simulations, 
  * but will at least cover the ones that relate to statistical models.
- It is still very useful to know the different types of distributions that random variables can take.


- Note that (in Frequentist inference statistics) 
  * a **"parameter"** is a quantity that is CONSTANT. 
  * a **"variable"** can take multiple values. 
- BUT a parameter could become a variable if this is the thing we want to see how it affects our models. 
- Greek letters are often used to denote these parameters

# Tips when performing simulation

.alert[Description section]. Add a 'Description' section to all your simulation scripts to introduce what the script is about. 

- You can add information how to use important arguments or a step-by-step description on how to use the script.
- You can add some references that you used to build your scrip. 

.small[
```r
# Description  ------------------------------------------------------------
#### ### ### ## #### ### ### ## #### ### ### ## 
# TITLE OF THE SCRIPT
# Created by YOUR_NAME
# 
# Why: 
# Requires:
# NOTES: 
# Reference : 
#### ### ### ## #### ### ### ## #### ### ### ## 

# Code here ... 

```
]

???
- Before the meat of the presentation, I want to give you this tip. 
- Here we present a 'header' that you could use at the beginning of EACH of you script
- Believe us, it makes it much easier when you go back to an old script if you have at least this information in the header.

# Tips when performing simulation

.alert[Comments]. Be extra generous when commenting your code to describe as precisely as possible for the information that is not variable. 


.small[

```r
# Description  ------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the description section as previously presented 

# Libraries ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Here load the libraries used in the script 
library(ggplot2)

# Functions ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Add and describe the functions used in the script 
## Add more information
function.name = function(var){tmp=2+var; return(tmp)}

# Plots -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Plotting the data simulated 
## Add more information
plot(function.name(1:10)+rnorm(10))
```
]

.small[
(We used fewer comments to lighten the presentation, but please add comments.)
]

???
- Also don't forget to add sections in your script. 
  - On macOS press `Alt + Shift + K` to get the shortcut list of RStudio. 
  - See the `Cmd + Shift + R` to automatically add a section that will be visible in the document outline. 

- Time to run a simulation is important: knowing that some functions are faster in R can make a difference for a slow simulation with a fast one.

# When could a simulation be useful? 

???
You might be wondering: 
- "OK, I somewhat understand how learning to perform simulations in R might be useful to me. 
- But WHEN should I use simulations in my work?"

---
# ALL THE TIME!!!! 

- Simulations can help you at all stages of your research from planning to publishing and beyond! 
- Whether you want to: 
1. Learn about science in general
  - learn how a mechanism work (i.e., genetic drift, natural selection), 

2. Design a particular study 
  - test a statistical method or a research question you have, 
  - play with data before your field work, 
  - simulate random point on a map to sample it, 

3. Publish an article 
  - respond to reviewers for a paper you want to publish,
  
4. etc. 


???
- The surprising answer is that it can be **used at all stages of research**. 
- Here is a short list of elements for when you could be using it

---
# Quick example: Genetic drift

- Here we have 4 plots showing genetic drift with the same simulation. 
- The only difference is the number of individuals in each population
- Your can deduce many things from the allele frequency change.

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/r_tips2-1.png" width="936" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
- Here is an example of simulation that was made in R to show genetic drift without natural selection. 
- The same script, or function, can be used to generate patterns like these, but by varying the parameters (population sizes or starting alleles). 
- Each plot contains 5 populations that started with an allele which had a frequency of 50%. 
- You can see now see with the simulation that 
  * No **particular** allele will be fixated (unbiased)
  * the **number of individuals** seems an important factor in the fixation of alleles. The fluctuations in allele fq are largers in smaller pop. 
  * some genetic variation can be **lost**
  * **makes populations different**, even if the pop are identical at the beginning. 
  * **Fixation** of an allele without natural selection 

- See also this example [Online Box 5: R code to simulate drift, selection, and dispersal of two species in any number of patches: Figures 6.7-6.9 in the book](http://mvellend.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/Box5.htm)

---
# Quick (?) example: Natural selection 

- How would you model natural selection?
???
- If natural selection is the non random transmission of genetic information in living organisms in a particular environment, how would you simulate that? 
- (From Futuyma, Evolution) [Non-random] Differential survival and/or reproduction of classes of entities that differ in one or more [transmissible] characteristics which, as a consequence, alter the proportions of the different entities [in subsequent generations].
--

- What is the type of selection we want to simulate? 
- What is being selected? What is that type of data (continuous [range?], discrete [counts?])? 


&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/fake_fitness_functions-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
--

- But what all of these mean? 
- What do they assume? 
- What is the data generated to make these lines and curves? 


???
- We won't answer the last questions for this moment. 
- In order to build a natural selection simulator in R, we need a couple of tools.

# Building simulations is an iterative process 

.alert[ATTENTION]. Usually, coding simulation is written in small increments and then put  together in a cohesive function that will make what we are looking for. 

- It takes practice to code simulations: the more you code, the more you develop tricks. 
- Always try to relate your simulation to a certain question of interest. This will bring more meaning to the insights that you are trying to make. 

In this section, we will discover functions that might help when coding simulations in R.

# Functions useful in simulations (RNG)

- When performing simulations, you will have to play with (pseudo-)randomly generated numbers from a random number generator (RNG). 
- This is a challenge if we want to replicate the analysis we are performing. 
- `R` has the function `set.seed()` that help us to play with the RNG.

The example below uses a RNG to extract numerical value between 1 and 10



```r
runif(n = 1, min = 1, max = 10) # Gives a random number between 1 and 10
# [1] 3.588198
runif(n = 1, min = 1, max = 10) # RNG wasn't reset, different answer (see above)
# [1] 8.094746
runif(n = 1, min = 1, max = 10) # Different again... 
# [1] 4.680792

set.seed(42); runif(n = 1, min = 1, max = 10) # This sets the RNG 
# [1] 9.233254
set.seed(42); runif(n = 1, min = 1, max = 10) # The exact same number 
# [1] 9.233254
```

???
- To go deeper: The actual pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) which is default in R is called the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) (see `??set.seed`) 
- `set.seed(seed, kind = "Mersenne-Twister")`

---
# Functions useful in simulations (sample)

- The function `sample()` randomly picks a value from a vector (i.e., random sampling).

The example below uses a RNG to extract numerical value between 1 and 10



```r
set.seed(12) # Set the RNG 
v.1.10 = 1:10 # Make a vector from 1 to 10 
# Randomly pick 1 (size) value from the vector (x), without replacement 
sample(x = v.1.10, size = 1, replace = FALSE) 
# [1] 2
```

- The values don't have to be numerical: they could be characters or factors


```r
set.seed(3) # Set the RNG 
# Randomly pick 5 (size) letters from the vector (x), without replacement 
sample(x = LETTERS, size = 5, replace = FALSE) 
# [1] "E" "L" "G" "D" "H"
sample(x = as.factor(month.abb), size = 5, replace = FALSE) 
# [1] Nov Aug Apr Jul Dec
# Levels: Apr Aug Dec Feb Jan Jul Jun Mar May Nov Oct Sep
```

**Permutations**:
- a rearrangement of a complex object, collection, etc., or the result of this rearrangement (See [Wikipedia's article about permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation))
- Imagine a Rubik's cube. If you rotate one side, you got a permutation of the cube (a new arrangement)

- for permutations 
  * 1st plot: not permutated
  * 2nd plot: x permutated
  * 3rd plot: x and y permutated
- The highlighted lines are where the permutation occurs

                to = as.Date('2022/01/01'),

# Functions useful in simulations (sample)

- You can also generate a die and randomly toss it. 
- You can change the probability of landing on one face more than the other.

# Functions useful in simulations (rep)

- Numerical values are not the only type of class you'll see in simulations. Characters (or factors) can be generated in `R` easily. 
- The `rep()` function can help you with this


```r
(let4first = LETTERS[1:4])
# [1] "A" "B" "C" "D"
rep(let4first, times = 2) # Repeat the WHOLE sequence twice 
# [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "A" "B" "C" "D"
rep(let4first, each = 2) # Repeat each element twice 
# [1] "A" "A" "B" "B" "C" "C" "D" "D"
# Set the number of repeat for each element in the vector 
rep(let4first, times = c(1,2,3,6))
#  [1] "A" "B" "B" "C" "C" "C" "D" "D" "D" "D" "D" "D"
# Complete replication: replicate each element twice and do this three times 
rep(let4first, each = 2, times = 3)
#  [1] "A" "A" "B" "B" "C" "C" "D" "D" "A" "A" "B" "B" "C" "C" "D" "D" "A" "A" "B"
# [20] "B" "C" "C" "D" "D"
rep(let4first, length.out = 6) # Repeat the vector until you hit the length.out
# [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "A" "B"
```

???
- It is useful to make a vector with multiple copies of some values
- rather than doing it by hand, you can use `rep()`


---
# Functions useful in simulations (gl)

- There are functions in `R` that can help you generate factor levels (with the `gl` function). 


```r
nb.of.levels = 2
nb.of.replicates = 8
labels.for.the.factors = c("Control", "Treat")
## First control, then treatment:
gl(n = nb.of.levels, k = nb.of.replicates, labels = labels.for.the.factors)
#  [1] Control Control Control Control Control Control Control Control Treat  
# [10] Treat   Treat   Treat   Treat   Treat   Treat   Treat  
# Levels: Control Treat

## 20 alternating 1s and 2s
gl(n = 2, k = 1, length = 20)
#  [1] 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
# Levels: 1 2

## alternating pairs of 1s and 2s
gl(n = 2, k = 2, length = 20)
#  [1] 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2
# Levels: 1 2
```

???
- rather than using rep and then factors, you can use the Generate Factor Levels `gl()` function

---
# Functions useful in simulations (replicate)

- In some cases, you want to replicate data, for example when you want to generate multiple populations at once with the same parameters
- `replicate()` can be used instead of a `for loop` and make simulations faster. 


```r
set.seed(1234)
data.replicated = replicate(n = 2,
                            expr = data.frame(gr = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 2),
                                              y = rnorm(6)), 
                            simplify = FALSE)
```
.pull-left[

```r
data.replicated[[1]]
#   gr          y
# 1  A -1.2070657
# 2  A  0.2774292
# 3  B  1.0844412

# 4  B -0.8900378
# 5  C -0.4771927
# 6  C -0.9983864
```
]

???
- This function allows you to call a function `n` number of times and to record the output. 
- In this case, it generates 2 simulated (different) dataframes which can be used in a simulation to get some replication all at once. I think this comes handy with the `apply`, `do.call`, etc. 
- Often, we are interested in *the behaviour of a simulation in the long run*. This means that we want to not only look at 1 simulated event, but at some *'performance'* estimation (maybe showing the spread of a parameter that could be distributed based on the sample size)

---
# Functions useful in simulations (expand.grid)

- The function `expand.grid()` will make a data frame from all combinations of factor variables
- It can be useful when making hypothesis testing or want to explore an experimental design 


```r
set.seed(1234)
exp.design = expand.grid(height = seq(60, 70, 10), 
                         weight = seq(100, 200, 100),
                         sex = c("Male","Female"), 
                         stringsAsFactors = TRUE) # characters will be factors
head(exp.design)
#   height weight    sex
# 1     60    100   Male
# 2     70    100   Male
# 3     60    200   Male
# 4     70    200   Male

## Challenge 1 - Solution ![:cube]()

Select randomly 4 values out of a vector of numbers ranging from 1 to 10 : 1. without replacement and 2. with replacement.


```r
set.seed(12345) # Sets the random number generator to a fix value
vec.1.10 = 1:10 # Make the vector to choose from 
sample(x = vec.1.10, size = 4, replace = FALSE) # Sample 4 nb without replacement
# [1] 3 8 2 5
sample(x = vec.1.10, size = 4, replace = TRUE) # Sample 4 nb with replacement
# [1] 8 2 6 6
```

As you can see in the last example, there are 2 "6"s, since each time a random number was picked, all numbers could be randomly chosen. 

1000 draws with replacement from 0 or 1, with equal probability for each. 

```r
set.seed(123); table(sample(x = 0:1, size = 1000, replace = T,prob = c(.5,.5)))
# 
#   0   1 
# 493 507

- Some students might point out that the error `\(\epsilon\)` is missing. They can add it if they want. Just make sure to verify that the mean of `\(\epsilon\)` is indeed `0`, and that they are concious about the sd they could change.

x = 1:10
y = 2 + 3 * x
gr = rep(letters[1:2],each = 5)

```

???
- Note that the regression is "perfect". This is not what we typically see when collecting data. Why? because here the `\(\epsilon\)` term is missing. This is the random error term that each measurement has. 
- The `\(\epsilon\)` is drawn from a normal distribution with mean=0 and a none-zero sd.

- When describing the "chance" or "likelihood" of an outcome, you can use a probability or odds
- They are related: odds of an event is `\(odds = p/(1-p)\)`  or `\(odds = \frac{\text{probability of success}}{\text{probability of failure}}\)`
- Why bother using probability or odds? 
???
- Let's explore the basic concepts like probability and odds.  
- This is important when you start simulating data, but also understand how to interpret some of the equations that we'll see later when we want to develop simulations for certain models  
--

- probability ranges between 0 and 1, but odds range from 0 to `\(\infty\)`.

- As you can see, it can be useful to change the scale on which the probability is shown. The "Odds scale" is aiming in the direction of having a scale where all the number are represented. 
- But as you can see, the odds of losing is not symmetric (between 0 and 1) compared to odds of winning (between 1 and `\(\infty\)`). How can we solve that? 

???
- Log odds is convenient as it makes the odds of losing and winning symmetric 
  - See: 
  - `log(1/6) =-1.7918` and 
  - `log(6/1) = 1.7918`
- References 
  - Seriously, check this post: [Probability vs Odds](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-vs-odds-f47fbc6789f4). It is amazing!

# Probability and odds 

- By using the log of the odds. 
- Log (natural log, or ln) odds can range from `\(-\infty\)` to `\(\infty\)` and makes the odds symmetric. It is calculated as `\(ln (odds) = ln(p/(1-p))\)` (i.e., the logit function).
- This will become handy when building a logistic model as this is the 'logit' transformation. 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="338.4" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


&lt;!-- .alert[Careful!] This is not the same as saying `\(success/(success + failure)\)`. This last calculation is the probability --&gt;
???
- The odds ratio and the log odds ratio is a bit like the R-squared: 
  * it indicates a relationship between 2 things (it's an effect size, or how one is a good predictor of the other (if the value is large))

- Also, the Geometric mean (which is the mean of logs) is BETTER when using log-based data (qPCR, where the data doubles each round) and is less sensitive to outliers (which the arithmetic mean is actually VERY sensitive)


```r
raw.num = c(1,2,8) # numbers NOT on the log scale (simulate a DOUBLING process like qPCR)
mean(raw.num) # Arithmetic average (which would be WRONG)
# [1] 3.666667
mean.log = mean(log(raw.num)/log(2)) # Taking the mean of the log (this is the geometric mean)
mean.log # Mean, on the log scale, for the raw numbers transformed: log(raw.num)
# [1] 1.333333
2^mean.log
# [1] 2.519842
# gm = exp(mean(log(raw.num))) # calculating the geometric mean 
gm = 2^(mean(log(raw.num)/log(2))) # Here we calculate the geometric mean with a base 2
# Now compare the geometric mean of the raw numbers with the mean of the log, transformed back into the raw number scale 
gm
# [1] 2.519842
2^mean.log
# [1] 2.519842
```

# Probability and odds

- Example: a horse runs 100 races and wins 20 of them.  What is the **odds** of winning?
- `\(odds = p/(1-p)\)`  or `\(odds = \frac{\text{probability of success}}{\text{probability of failure}}\)`


```r
tot.nb.ev = 100; success = 20
odds.favor = (success)/(tot.nb.ev-success) # Odds in favor of event ( 1 in 4)
odds.agnst = (tot.nb.ev-success)/(success) # Odds against the event (here 4 to 1)
```

&lt;!-- In the calculation above, I'm NOT using the probability of successes as the division by 100 (to make it a probability) would cancel out and make it harder to get a quick intuition from the toy example --&gt;

The horse wins 1 race to 4 fails (odds of winning = 0.25).
So, for 5 races it will win 1 and loose 4. 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="338.4" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


Conversely, the horse  odds of failing is 4:1 (read 4 *to* 1). 
The horse is 4 times more *likely* to fail than to succeed in a race.

???
- If the `odds = 1` or `log(odds)= 0`: 
  * it means that we are as likely to win, as we are likely to lose 

- Another example: for a 6-sided die, 
  * the odds of rolling a 6 is 1:5 (one TO 5)
  * the odds of rolling a 5 OR a 6 is 2:4 (2 TO 4)

- in French, Odds is the "cote" (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cote_(probabilités))
- Also, be careful. Probability and likelihood IS NOT THE SAME

---
# Probability and odds 

- Example: a horse runs 100 races and wins 20 of them. What is the **probability** of winning?
- `\(p = odds/(1+odds)\)`


```r
tot.nb.ev = 100; success = 20
probability.favor = (success)/(tot.nb.ev) # probability of event (here 20%)
probability.favor # fractions(probability.favor)
# [1] 0.2
```
- So the horse *wins* 1/5 or 20% of the times. 
- The probability of a particular outcome (say getting a *head* for a coin) for a particular event (tossing a coin) is the number of a particular outcome divided by the total number of results from the event. 
???
- Probability is the number of a *certain event* divided by the total number of events. 
- but you can convert from odds to probability. 
--

- You can see that `\(odds = p/(1-p) = (.2)/(1-.2) = .2/.8 = 1/4\)`

---
# Probability and odds 

- Let's code the difference between probability, odds and log odds. 


```r
# Get some LOG ODDS numbers 
log_odds = seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = .25)
# Transformed into odds 
odds = exp(log_odds)
# Make 
inv.logit &lt;- function(x) {exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))}
p = inv.logit(log_odds) # This is the same as 
p2 = odds/(1 + odds)
# Probability of failure (1-p)
q = 1-p

# Store log_odds other data to plot 
d = data.frame(log_odds, odds, p, p2, q) 

head(signif(d,2), 3)
#   log_odds   odds      p     p2    q
# 1     -5.0 0.0067 0.0067 0.0067 0.99
# 2     -4.8 0.0087 0.0086 0.0086 0.99
# 3     -4.5 0.0110 0.0110 0.0110 0.99
```

???
- We first generate a series of number in LOG odds that we will transform in the probability scale (between 0 and 1)

# Probability and odds 

- The three plots show the contrast between probability, odds and log odds.


```r
o.lo = d$odds~d$log_odds
p.o = d$p~d$odds
p.lo = d$p~d$log_odds
plot(o.lo, type="l", ylab="Odds", xlab="Ln odds", lwd=3); abline(v=0, lty=3)
plot(p.o,  type="l", ylab="p",    xlab="Odds",    lwd=3); abline(h=.5, v=0, lty=3)
plot(p.lo, type="l", ylab="p",    xlab="Ln odds", lwd=3); abline(h=.5, v=0, lty=3)
```

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/odds_prob_plot-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
- You can recognize from the third graph, the familiar shape of a logistic regression. This is purely due to the transformation of space from [0,1] to ]-infinity, infinity[.

# Probability and odds 

- What is the difference between a probability and a p-value?
--

- A p-value consists of 3 parts. They are the :
  1. *Probability* that random chance generated the data (or would give the result we got) **PLUS**
  2. *Probability* of observing something else that is equally rare **PLUS**
  3. *Probability* of observing something else that is rarer (or more extreme).
???
- Let's just spend some time explaining the DIFFERENCE between a probability and a *p-value*. 
- Note also that the p-value for CONTINUOUS variables is the area under the curve AT the value and GREATER or LOWER the CRITICAL value or BOTH depending on the test. 
- See [StatQuest: P Values, clearly explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z9OIYA8He8&amp;ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer), [How to calculate p-values ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQc3yx0-Q9E&amp;t=0s&amp;ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer) and [p-values: What they are and how to interpret them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vemZtEM63GY&amp;ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer)
--

- **NOTE:** the probability of an event occurring *is not the same* as the p-value, since the p-value is the sum of 3 parts.
  - We add part 2. and 3. because it gives us information about the *specialness* of this rare event. 
  - In other words, we want to know if the event we measured is statistically special or, as you might have heard it, statistically significant!

# Why statistical distributions matter? 

- As we discussed in the introduction, we are interested in what is underlying natural processes.
- To be able to mimic the natural processes, we need a way to get some similar data as we would if we collect them (we need a way to generate (pseudo-)random variables).
???
- Here, we are coming back to the idea of looking at pattern in random processes. 
- random variables in the natural world are generated from what has been called statistical distribution. 
- Statistician have been studying random variables by mapping , measuring, describing, and making taxonomies of them which now they are able to understand them in a more general way: based on statistical distributions from which they are drawn. 
- Take a look at Khan Academy [Random variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables)
--

- In other words, to help us in performing simulations, we need to get some data (random variables, X) which numerical values are outcomes of random processes. 
- The idea here is to find the distribution underlying a random process which generate a particular phenomenon in nature and use it to output values to be used in your simulation.
- After generating the data, you can analyze it and see how it can be manipulated. 


---
# What is a random variable? 

- Imagine a number is presented to you like so:




```
# [1] 13.9
```
???
- This is an exercise to let the attendees feel what are random variables and why statistical distributions are interesting. 
--

- From which distribution is this variable coming from?
--

- Would be helpful to have more information 


---
# What is a random variable? 

- Now imagine you are able to get more numbers from the same process:


```
# [1] 13.9 14.5 18.1 15.1 15.3
```
???
- Here, we just increase the amount of values that we can get from a random process to try to characterize it. 
- We can now calculate some properties of this data. 
--

- This is more informative. We can take the mean and the standard deviation of these numbers: mean = 15.4, sd = 1.6. 
--

- Again, from which distribution is this variable coming from?
--

- We could plot the result to get a feel of the distribution:

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/feel_random_var_hist_5-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- Still hard to definitely tell 

---
# What is a random variable? 

- What if you get even more numbers (say 100) from the same random process:

.tiny[

```
#   [1] 13.9 14.5 18.1 15.1 15.3 18.4 15.9 12.5 13.6 14.1 17.4 15.7 15.8 15.2 13.9
#  [16] 18.6 16.0 11.1 16.4 14.1 12.9 14.6 12.9 13.5 13.7 11.6 16.7 15.3 12.7 17.5
#  [31] 15.9 14.4 16.8 16.8 16.6 16.4 16.1 14.9 14.4 14.2 13.6 14.6 12.5 19.3 17.4
#  [46] 12.8 14.2 14.1 16.6 14.8 15.5 14.9 14.9 17.7 14.5 18.0 11.9 16.2 15.2 15.4
#  [61] 15.8 14.0 14.3 13.0 12.9 15.6 15.9 15.1 16.8 19.1 14.0 10.4 17.0 13.6 13.6
#  [76] 17.1 14.4 12.6 15.4 14.7 15.0 15.8 14.3 16.3 14.6 15.7 17.2 15.9 14.3 17.3
#  [91] 17.0 16.1 15.5 13.7 17.7 13.8 19.4 18.1 14.5 12.9
```
]

???
- With more and more data, we can get a better intuition of the underlying distribution that generated the data. 
--

- The mean = 15.4, sd = 1.6. 
- Check the graph

# Summary of important distribution 

- Distributions of random variables comes in 2 flavors: 
  1. Discrete (infinite *integer* number of *distinct* values, e.g., `0`, `5`, `19`,...)
  2. Continuous (infinite decimal number of possible values, e.g., `0.1`,`0.62113`,...)

| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Binomial	   | probability of *n* repeated *yes/no* experiments with probability *p* of *success* | discrete; yes/no; 0/1 | Number of heads in a row after 3 tosses |
| Poisson	     | probability of a number of cases happening in a defined range of time or space given a constant rate | discrete; | ticks of a radiation counter, DNA mutation, colonization of animals on remote islands (something per unit time or space for example) |
| Logistic	   | probability of an individual to be in one class or another | continuous; | alive or not, yes or no, diseased or not, etc. |
| Normal	     | probability function which informs how values are distributed, centered on a mean, being symmetric, and having a specific variance | continuous; | height of individuals, beak length, shoe size, time required to run a kilometer, the data shows a 'bell-shaped' curve |

# The same distribution? 

.alert[Careful!]

- Some distribution are similar but don't show the same process 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/similar_plot_from_different_distributions-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
???
- Just keep in mind that some distributions can be approximated with other, but the important point to note is to respect the *type* of data that is generated from a distribution. 

---
# Other distributions with packages

- Other packages have other distributions. See the [CRAN Task View: Probability Distributions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html) if you need a funky distribution that doesn't come in `base R`.
- Some distributions can be recreated in `R` even if they haven't their own function name (e.g., Bernoulli). 
  * Bernoulli distribution can be simulated with a binomial distribution with `size = 1`.

# Poisson distribution

- To be Poisson distributed, the data generally assumes that 
  - the probability of some event is small over a short period of time (or area), but that there are a lot of events (as there would be a lot of time passing, or a lot of space) in which the process could happen 
  - The number of event reported is independent from one time point to the other. 
  - In summary, it models *rare* events that happen at a certain *rate*. In other words, there are many opportunities to succeed (n is large), but the probability of success (for each trial) is small. 
  
- The probability mass function is:

`$$f(x) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^x}{x!}$$` where `\(\mu = \sigma^2 = \lambda\)`

???
- See the article [The Poisson Distribution and Poisson Process Explained](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-poisson-distribution-and-poisson-process-explained-4e2cb17d459) "A Poisson Process is a model for a series of discrete event where the average time (or space) between events is known, but the exact timing of events is random. The arrival of an event is independent of the event before (waiting time between events is memoryless)."

# Poisson distribution

- Examples (something per unit time or space for example): 
  - Nb of deaths due to a disease (e.g., SARS-CoV 2) for a period of time 
  - Ticks of a radiation counter (Geiger counter which detects and measures ionizing radiation)
  - DNA mutation
  - Colonization of animals on remote islands
  - Mutation models
  - Recombination models 
  - Bacteria colonies growing on an agar plate 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/petri_dish_bacteria_colonny-1.png" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- For the bacterial colonies, if you sample small units of space, you can count the number of bacteria colonies

# Poisson distribution

- In `R`, you can generate Poisson distributed variables with the `rpois` function. Below is the structure of the function. 

```
rpois(n = number of repetitions,
      lambda = rate)
```

- You can think of this function as the number of times you'd get a success, when the number of events per unit of time or space is lambda 
- E.g., with a camera trap, I see on average 2 wolves/day (lambda is this rate, doesn't need to be an integer), then if I on the field for one day, what could be the number of wolves that I observe? 


```r
set.seed(5937); rpois(n = 1,lambda = 2)
# [1] 5
```
- Wow! That day was amazing! The probability of seeing this number is 0.04 and the probability of seeing 5 or more is 0.02

  * the height is the probability of getting a certain value 
- the last 2 graphs are the pseudo-randomly generated numbers from a Poisson distribution
  * The height of the bars are the FREQUENCY of the data for certain bins 

- How would you calculate the probability of getting X number of events or more from these graphs.
  * If you have a probability mass function (PMF), you can just add the probabilities of the X number of events and MORE
  * If you have a frequency histogram, you need to get the probability of observing the data first and get sum as the PMF (if R, you can just use the `ppois()` function as this just does that.)

# Binomial distribution

- Binomial distribution is finite (n is not infinite) and discrete.
- Binomial distribution assumes that:
  - Each *independent* trial is either a success (1, T, Yes) or failure (0, F, No)
  - There is a *fixed* number of trials and the probability on each trial is constant.

- The probability mass function is:

$$f(x) = {n \choose x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x} $$
where 
- `\(p\)` is the probability of success in a single trial (so `\((1-p)\)` is the probability of failure, sometimes seen as `\(q\)`)
- `\(n\)` is the number of trials 
- `\(x\)` is the number of trials that are successes
- `\({n \choose x} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\)` is the number of combinations where the order doesn't matter. 

???
- Note that a 'success' or 'failure' is a *contrast* between 2 elements. 
  * These could be 'heads/tail', 'girl/boy', 'diseased/not', etc.
- The probability of success or failiure DON'T change as the experiment goes: e.g., the probability of heads or tail for a coin should not change as the experiment is conducted. 
- See the lecture [Binomial Distribution](https://www.montana.edu/rotella/documents/502/BinomDist.html)
- The function `choose()` is used in R to find the number combinations (regardless of the order). For example, if you just want to know the number of combinations you can have from choosing 6 numbers out of 49, it is 1.3983816\times 10^{7}. If you wish to know the chances of winning the lotteries it's 7.1511238\times 10^{-8}.

# Binomial distribution

- Examples 
  - Number of heads in a row after 3 tosses (heads or tail)
  - Wright-Fisher model (Genetic drift, p and q)
  - Testing the side effects of a new medications (with and without effect)
  - Model river overflows due to excessive rain (overflows or not). 

???
- Wright–Fisher model is a mathematical model of genetic drift. p and q are the frequency of 2 different alleles. (Generations do not overlap, like annual plants, and that the copy of the gene in the new generation is independently drawn from the gene pool of the previous generation)
  * Here is a simulation of the Wright-Fisher model [Introduction to the Wright-Fisher Model](https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/wright_fisher_model.html#simulating_the_wright-fisher_model) (cleaner compared to my version!)
- For the medical side effect (affected or not), the river overflows (overflow or not) example, read [5 Real-Life Examples of the Binomial Distribution](https://www.statology.org/binomial-distribution-real-life-examples/)

# Binomial distribution

- Example 1: probability of having a certain number of offspring with a certain genotype (e.g., Aa) given the genotypes of the parents 
  - If a male (AA) mates a female (Aa), what is the probability that 6 of their 7 offspring is Aa (7 choose 6)
  - The probability of getting Aa from AA x Aa is [1/2 AA and 1/2 Aa], 
  - `\(P(6|7) = {7 \choose 6} (1/2)^6(1-1/2)^{7-6} = 7/128\)` (about 0.055)
- Example 2: Probability of having 3 daughters if you have 5 children.
  * if you have 5 children, these are independent trials, so n = 5
  * "success" is the probability that the child is a daughter (p = 1/2)
  * `\(P(3|5) = {5 \choose 3} (1/2)^3(1-1/2)^{5-3} = 5/16\)` (about 0.31)

# Binomial distribution

```
rbinom(n = number of repetitions,
       size = sample size, # between 0 and up to the size 
       p = probability of success)
```

- Think of it as the number of times you'd get a success, with probability `\(p\)`, for a number of times you repeat the experiment.

- Some of the distributions may *look* normal, but they are NOT. 
- If you look at the histograms and plot the "density", you can see that it can go ABOVE 1. It makes more sense to see the probabilities as the AREA under such curve.

# Poisson distribution vs binomial

- Difference between Binomial and Poisson distrivutions:
  - Number of events in Poisson can be infinite (so n tends towards infinity and the probability of each event approaches 0)
  - Number of trials is finite ( `\(n\)` ) in Binomial distribution

# Normal distribution (Gaussian)

- This distribution is the most important to know (see Central limit theorem). 
- It has interesting properties (mean: center, sd: spread, bell-shaped, symmetry, etc.)
- Can approximate other distribution (might require data transformation)
- The normal distribution with mean = 0 and sd = 1 is called the **Standard Normal**

The general form of the probability density function for a normal distribution is 

`$$f(x)={\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}}e^{-{\frac{1}{2}}\Bigl(\frac {x-\mu}{\sigma}\Bigr)^2}$$`

The important part here is the mean `\(\mu\)` and the standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`. Usually summarized as `\(N(\mu, \sigma)\)`

???
- This is one of the most important distribution in statistics
- We will spend some time to understand it better
- we will look at some of its properties 
- If you are interested, you could show the graph on [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator), an online scientific and graphic calculator. There, you could write `\(e^{-s^{-2}\left(x-m\right)^{2}}\)` and show the result (add the slider for m and s to show what they do). It is approximately Bell curve = `\(e^{-x^2}\)`

```

# Normal distribution (Gaussian)

  - Arm length, or human height in a population
  - velocity of a collection of molecules in a gas of liquid
  - the error from measurements (length of beak).

- We showed earlier that different functions can give the values needed to plot the PDF or prob. density function. 
- With `dnorm`, we are going to show some properties of the Norm. distribution. 
- This is a standard norm. curve (mean=0, sd=1)
- The graph shows the x values (which in this case could be any real value that is scaled; human height where we removed the mean and devided by the sd)
- The y axis is the DENSITY of finding the values. It can RANGE from 0 to large values (not necessarily 1). The important point is that the TOTAL AREA UNDER THE CURVE is 1, so that it can represent a probability, for a density curve.

.pull-right[
For the density distribution, the *area* under the curve between two points is the *probability*. For example, the 95% probability (red region), and 2 tails 2.5% (blue region).

- In this plot, there is the same standard normal curve, but some important values are plotted as well
- First, the AREA UNDER THE CURVE BETWEEN 2 POINTS is the PROBABILITY of finding data between those 2 points. 
  * the red area is the probability between about 2sd on EACH side of the mean (~95%)
- There is a second distribution (green line) shown as the density which are 100 randomly drawn points from a standard normal curve. You can see that the black and green line are pretty close, but they are not the same. 
`qnorm(.025) = -1.96`

# Quantile value for a normal distribution 

If X is a random variable distributed with a *Standard normal distribution*, what is the probability of finding X less or equal to `\(1.645\)`. In other words,  `\(P(X\leq 1.645)\)` where `\(X\sim N(0,1)\)`?

- The cool thing is that now, we can calculate the probabilities of any given RANGE of x values
- The `lower.tail` argument is a logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are `\(P[X \leq x]\)` otherwise, `\(P[X \gt x]\)`. Here `lower.tail=F` since I wanted to show the TOP probability (from the UPPER tail)

- These are different standard normal distributions where we ploted different probabilities (area under the curve), for different RANGES of X. Compare the 1st and the second row-middle graph and the last graph. The three are 95% in the red portion, BUT the tails have different areas.

- So from the mean of the standard normal distribution:
  * if you are at `\(\mu \pm 1 \sigma\)` , you have 68.27% of the data. 
  * At `\(\mu \pm 2 \sigma\)` it's 95.45% and at `\(\mu \pm 3 \sigma\)` it's 99.73%

- We could show what is the PROBABILITY of finding certain data at a certain distance (in standard deviation units) from BOTH sides of the MEAN.
- In other words, we want to find the probability of getting data in the red area. 
- We calculated the probability from the LOWER tail (when x = 1, 2, and 3) and the probability from the UPPER tail (when x = 1, 2, and 3) and substracted both to the probability in THE MIDDLE.

- for a probability of `\(50\%\)` between the "x" value is -0.67, 0.67. 
- for a probability of `\(90\%\)` between the "x" value is -1.64, 1.64. 
- for a probability of `\(95\%\)` between the "x" value is -1.96, 1.96.

- We could also look at the values of X to which we would observe a certain probability of data on EACH SIDE of the mean
- Note that instead of looking at the probabilities in the lower and upper tails, we could simply take the other side of the probability (substrating the probability by 1 `qnorm(p = 1-c(.75, .95,.975, .995), mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = F)`)

- Here are showing the null hypothesis (black curve) and the theoretical distribution from a sample

  * **type 1 error (alpha)**: the probability to reject the null hypothesis even if it is true (false alternative)
  * **type 2 error (beta)**: the probability to fail rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false
  * **Power (1-beta)**: probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false
  
- It is NOT a problem if the y value in the probability density function (PDF) is GREATER than one. 
- The important point here is that the AREA UNDER THE CURVE must sum to 1.

- An important take away here is that these areas change BASED ON THE SAMPLE SIZE that we have. 
- In this example, the sample distribution has a large SD and a sample size of 10. 
- How could we improve our CONFIDENCE in telling that there is a REAL difference between our sample and the null hypothesis. 
  * Increasing the sample size should make our estimate better (this is because the SAMPLING distribution would tend to have a more robust estimate since we are trying to estimate the mean, which is closer to the true population when the sample size is large, see `\(\text{SE}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)`, which we will see with the central limit theorem later)

# Convert a Normal dist. to Standard Normal 

- If your data is normally distributed (i.e., `\(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\)`), you can convert the data to be `\(X \sim N(0, 1)\)` with a scaling
$$Z = \frac{(X-\mu)}{\sigma} $$ 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/Standard_normal_transformation-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- This is just a quick note to show you how to scale data and what effect it has on a distribution
- Left: SNorm curve with a theoretical distribution centered at 15 and sd 2. The blue curve is a density of 100 points taken from a normal distribution with the same parameters as the population. 
- Right: after scaling, you can see that all the data is now at a mean of 0 and a SD of 1.

# Central limit theorem (CLT)

- It has been said that if "physicists have general relativity, chemists have the periodic table of elements and biologists have evolution or DNA, statisticians have the central limit theorem" ([Nathan Uyttendaele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWTKVMf5HQI&amp;ab_channel=Lastatistiqueexpliqu%C3%A9e%C3%A0monchat)). 

- The Central limit theorem (CLT) stipulates that:
  * The more you add (sum) identically distributed *random variables*, the more the probability distribution of the new variable will tend to converge to a normal distribution (or is approximated by a normal distribution). 

- We will use simulations to test this assertion! 

???

- This is important: the more you ADD identically distributed variables together, the more their sum will tend towards a new distribution which is normal. 

- See explaination in French in [this video: Le théorème central limite - best of des aventures d'Albert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWTKVMf5HQI&amp;ab_channel=Lastatistiqueexpliqu%C3%A9e%C3%A0monchat) This is from Nathan Uyttendaele: "Physicists have general relativity and the elegant Maxwell equations, Chemists have the periodic table of elements and Biologists have evolution or the fascinating DNA molecule and statisticians have the central limit theorem!", from the original "Les physiciens ont la relativité générale et les élégantes équations de Maxwell, les chimistes ont le tableau périodique des éléments et les biologistes ont l'évolution ou encore la fascinante la molécule d'ADN et les statisticiens ont le théorème central limite!"

- See [Demonstrating The Central Limit Theorem in R](https://medium.com/@orrymr/demonstrating-the-central-limit-theorem-in-r-a5fef67cbbb)
- In other words, the distribution shown here is the sampling distribution of the mean. Its mean is the same as the original mean of the population, its standard deviation is called the standard error of the mean (SEM) and it is normally distributed! SEM is the variability in the collection of sample means. 
- See what happens when the sample size increases: `\(SEM = \sigma/\sqrt{n}\)`. This means that as `\(n \to \infty\)`, the standard error gets smaller. 
- Therefore, the *sampling distribution* of the *sample mean* (so the mean taken out of a sample, multiple times with various samples), approximate a normal distribution, even if the underlying process is not from a normal distribution. `\(\bar X \sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt {n}})\)` or the mean of x is approximately normally distributed as with mean mu and variance

Now that we have a better understanding of distributions and how to play with them, we are going to look into the subject of power analysis.

# Power analysis (proportions)

- The [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html) for the `pwr` package explains how to perform power analysis. 
- We think we have a coin, which has a 75% chance of landing on 'heads':


```r
p1 = .75 # Proportion to test 
p2 = .50 # proportion of the null hypothesis 
alpha = 0.05 # Type 1 error 
pwr = 0.80 # power or 1-beta = power. Beta is the type II error 
coin.p.power = power.prop.test(p1 = p1, p2 = p2, sig.level = alpha, power = pwr)
n = ceiling(coin.p.power$n) # get the sample size from the power analysis
coin.pip = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = p1) # Generate coin tosses 
p.table = table(coin.pip)[c(2,1)] # Get the number of 1 and 0s  
(ptest = prop.test(p.table, alternative = "greater")) # Do the test 
# 
# 	1-sample proportions test with continuity correction
# 
# data:  p.table, null probability 0.5
# X-squared = 1.3966, df = 1, p-value = 0.1187
# alternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.5
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#  0.4697935 1.0000000
# sample estimates:
#         p 
# 0.5862069
```


???
- Power analysis are useful to get a sense of the
  * sample size required to run an analysis
  * know the power 
  * get the effect size
  * or the significance level
- What we can do is prepare the power analysis to what we want to test, then generate data the we could use to see how this would modify the result of our test. 
- In this first example, we are looking at a proportion power test.

```
# coin.pip = rbinom(1,size = n,prob = p1) # similar to above 
# prop.test(x = coin.pip, n = n,alternative = "greater")
```

# Power analysis (proportions)

- from the output we got (previous slide), we can plot the chi-square distribution with the df and see where our statistics ends in the graph. We can see that the p-value must be pretty small. 


```r
curve(dchisq(x, df = ptest$parameter), 
      xlim = c(0, ceiling(max(ptest$statistic))))
abline(v = ptest$statistic, lty = 3)
```

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- The p-value is 0.119.

pwr.lm = pwr.f2.test(u = nb.coef.in.model, f2 = f2(.3), sig.level = 0.001, power = 0.8)

# sample size (n = v + u + 1)
n = ceiling(pwr.lm$v + nb.coef.in.model + 1)
n
# [1] 53
```


???
- based on the number of coefficients you have in a model, and the effect size you think you're going to have (perhaps based on the literature), you can find the number of samples you'd require in ordre to get find a statistical difference at the level that interests you. 
- Refer to the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html) for the `pwr` package
- See also the package `pwr2ppl`

# Power analysis (GLMM)

- The `simr` package uses simulations to perform power analysis for Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) with the `lme4` packge

???

- See [Power Analysis in R with GLMMs: Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh6zh9sN3As&amp;ab_channel=DaCCoTABiostatsCore)

# Linear model (lm) refresher

`$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1} + \cdots + \beta_{p} x_{p} + \epsilon$$`

- `\(Y\)` is the response variable
- `\(\beta_0\)` is the intercept
- `\(\beta_1\)` is the coefficient of variation for the first explanatory variable ( `\(x_1\)` )
- `\(\beta_p\)` is the coefficient of variation for the `\(p^{th}\)` explanatory variable for the `\(p^{th}\)` `\(x_p\)` explanatory variable
- `\(\epsilon\)` is the residual of the model. Note that `\(\epsilon \sim N(\mu=0,sd = \sigma)\)`

---
# Linear model (lm) refresher

- The goal is to find the **best estimation** of the parameters ( `\(\beta\)` s), while minimizing the residuals, and assess the goodness of fit of the model
- We use the least-squares in order to fit the line to the data.
- In order to interpret your results correctly when using a linear model, be sure you are not crossing the *LINE*: 
  * L: Linearity, 
  * I: Independence, 
  * N: normally distributed residuals, 
  * E: Equality of variance

# Generalized linear model (GLM) refresher

- What we've seen so far are cases in which the **response** variable was continuous and where the "error" is normally distributed.
- But there might be cases where the **response** variable is *not* continuous or has an error structure that is *not* normal. 
- Therefore, we need to look for GLMs. 

| Type | Equation |
| ---- | -------- |
| Linear | `\(Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1}  + \epsilon\)` |
| Poisson | `\(Y \sim Poisson(\mu)\)` with `\(\text {ln} \mu=\beta_0+\beta_1x\)` or `\(\mu=e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x}\)` (no separate error term as `\(\lambda\)` determines both the mean and variance) |
| Logistic | `\(Y \sim Binomial(p)\)` with `\(\text{log} \Bigl(\frac{p}{1-p}\Bigr) = \beta_0 +\beta_1x\)` or `\(p=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x}}\)` where `\(\text{log} \Bigl(\frac{p}{1-p}\Bigr)\)` is the log odds or log likelihood. The Y values are determined by a Bernoulli distribution (binomial of size = 1) |

- Keep in mind that the x-values *don't* *need to be normally distributed*. 

???

&lt;!-- 
In GLM, we don't model the individual Y values, but the mean
https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/generalized-linear-models-no-error-term/
In other words "there's no common error distribution independent of predictor values"
see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/124818/logistic-regression-error-term-and-its-distribution
--&gt;

# GLM: Linear model

- Now that we have the core elements to generate a lm, we can put the simulation inside a function and vary some parameters
- If we are interested in how our confidence in the slope estimate changes based on sample size we could replicate the simulation a certain number of times
  * We could plot the density of the estimates that we'd get out of the simulations. 
  * Below, slopes estimates were extracted from each simulation with various sample sizes. 
  * As the sample size increases, our slope estimation gets better to the "true" underlying value. 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
- This is an example of how a simulation script could be replicated to get a global understanding of the change of a parameter value (slope) by changing another value (sample size)
- This is where simulations shine. They really help us understand how we can interpret some results or get a better feeling of the confidence (or uncertainty) we have from our data. Or at least, this is one use of this. 

- I'd suggest opening RStudio to show the code 

---
# GLM: Linear model

- Same simulation as before, but now we plot the adjusted `\(R^2\)` from the linear model. 

&lt;img src="workshopXX-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- You can see from the plots that the effect size, the `\(R^2\)`, varies much more when the sample size is small. As the sample size increases, the spread around the effect size diminishes. 

???
- This makes a SUPER IMPORTANT POINT. The effect size in this case is the amount of variance explained. You can see that with the exact same model that we generated, we can have pretty much any type of effect size for a small sample size. 
- But as we increase the sample size, the effect size seems to converge on a particular value. 
- (note that if the `\(R^2\)` is negative, it could be thought as being 0.)
- This adds to the idea that larger sample sizes are important when you conduct a study. It's not just that the sample size makes the estimate better. It also plays with our CONFIDENCE in having a particular value for the effect size.

# GLM: Linear model (interaction; continuous)

- Here is the simulation of a linear model with an interaction term between two continuous variables. 
- The plot is to show that the relationship between `\(y\)` and `\(x_1\)` is modulated by `\(x_2\)` 
- If `\(\hat{y}=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_1x_2\)`, but you want to show the graph for `\(x_1\)`, we can rearrange the equation to this: 
  * `\(\hat{y}=(\beta_0+\beta_2x_2)+(\beta_1+\beta_3x_2)x_1\)`
  * You can see from the equation above that in order to get an intercept and slope for `\(x_1\)`, you need to specify a `\(x_2\)` value. Therefore, if you want to show the effect of `\(x_1\)` on `\(y\)` you need to set `\(x_2\)` to a certain value. So for a *given value of* `\(x_2\)`, the intercept on the y-axis is the first term `\((\beta_0+\beta_2x_2)\)` while the slope of `\(x_1\)` is `\((\beta_1+\beta_3x_2)\)`.

- After a certain time, say 6 months, you want to weight the dried plant material and test if there is an effect of your treatment 
- You've read in the literature that similar experiments have had a mean weight of 5.03g (standard deviation = 0.28) for the control and 4.66g (standard deviation = 0.49) for the treatment.
- Your scale adds and error of 0.3g of standard deviation to the measurement.
- Can you tell the proportion of p-values that will be significant with these details?

# GLM: Logistic

- Recall that logistic is `\(Y \sim Binomial(p)\)` with `\(\text{log} \Bigl(\frac{p}{1-p}\Bigr) = \beta_0 +\beta_1x\)` or `\(p=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x}}\)` where `\(\text{log} \Bigl(\frac{p}{1-p}\Bigr)\)` is the log odds or log likelihood. The Y values are determined by a Bernoulli distribution (binomial of size = 1) 
- We use maximum likelihood to fit a line to the data. It doesn't have 'residuals' and don't have an `\(R^2\)`
- Remember that in order to make the domain `\(]-\infty,\infty[\)` for the y values (instead of `\([0,1]\)`), we need to transform the probability to the `\(log(odds)\)`.

- `\(pr_2 = e^z/(1+e^z)\)` #  z being the log odds.

# Linear mixed model (LMMs) refresher

- A simple linear model is actually the 'simplest' mixed model (although the convention is that we don't called it mixed)
- What is the random effect in a linear model? 

`$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1} + \cdots + \beta_{p} x_{p} + \epsilon$$`

- The residual of the model ( `\(\epsilon\)` ) is actually the 'random effect' since it is drawn from a distribution which can change for each data point `\(\epsilon \sim N(\mu=0,sd = \sigma)\)`. 

---
# Linear mixed model (LMMs) refresher

- to simplify the linear model equation we are going to write it this way:
`$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\beta + \epsilon$$`
- This only means that `\(\mathbf{Y}\)` is a vector (or matrix) made up of the linear combination of fixed effects `\(\mathbf{X}\beta\)` and a random part `\(\epsilon\)`. 

- In this type of notation, LMMs is (random intercept):
`$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\beta + \mathbf{Z\upsilon} + \epsilon$$`

- With all the previous elements being the same but the random part which is composed of `\(\mathbf{Z \upsilon} + \epsilon\)`, for all categories `\(\mathbf{\upsilon}\)`. `\(\mathbf{X}\)` is the *design matrix* and `\(\mathbf{Z}\)`  is the *block matrix*.
- Just keep in mind that, as before, `\(\epsilon \sim N(\mu=0,sd = \sigma)\)` and `\(\mathbf{\upsilon} \sim N(\mu=0,sd = \mathbf{D})\)`, where `\(\mathbf{D}\)` is a variance-covariance matrix. Also, `\(\mathbf{\upsilon}\)` and `\(\epsilon\)` are independent.

---
# Linear mixed model (LMMs) refresher

- This is just another way to write the model (there is a part that specify the random slopes)

`$$y_{ij} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1ij} + \upsilon_{1j} x_{1ij} + \upsilon_{0ij} + \epsilon_{0ij}$$`
- `\(\epsilon_{0ij} \sim N(\mu=0,sd = \sigma_{e0})\)` and `\(\mathbf{\upsilon_{0j}} \text{ and } \mathbf{\upsilon_{1j}} \sim N(\mu=0,sd = \Omega_{\upsilon})\)` and `\(\Omega_{\upsilon} = \left[\begin{align*} \sigma_{\upsilon0}^2 &amp; \sigma_{\upsilon10} \\ \sigma_{\upsilon01} &amp; \sigma_{\upsilon1}^2 \end{align*}\right]\)`


---
# Linear mixed model (LMMs) refresher

- Just so that everything is extra clear
`$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\beta + \mathbf{Z \upsilon} + \epsilon$$`

One implementation of that could be ( `\(\beta_1\)` and `\(\beta_2\)` would represent different treatments, `\(v_1\)` and `\(v_2\)` are different categories):

`$$\left[\begin{array}{l} y_{11} \\ y_{21} \\ y_{12} \\ y_{22} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l} \beta_{1} \\ \beta_{2} \end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l} v_{1} \\ v_{2} \end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{l} \epsilon_{11} \\ \epsilon_{21} \\ \epsilon_{12} \\ \epsilon_{22} \end{array}\right]$$`

# Time series simulation

- In *The R book* (Crawley 2013) chapter 28 is about simulation models in R. It offers an introduction to temporal and spatial dynamics. 
- We suggest that for the moment, you consult the [Time Series Analysis CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html) which contains packages that can simualte time series for you to analyze. 
- You can also see [this guide to better understand Time series](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/12/complete-tutorial-time-series-modeling/)
- There is a neat tutorial by [Daniel Pinedo called Time series analysis in R](https://rpubs.com/odenipinedo/time-series-analysis-in-R)

# Spatial simulation

- The examples here were taken from [this post on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68761166/create-random-points-inside-a-shape-in-r)
- See also the help for `st_sample()`. In the *Examples* section, there are some neat simulations of points in polygons. 


```r
library(sf); library(ggplot2)
polygon = list(matrix(c(2, 2, 3, 3, 2.5, 4, 
                        3, 4, 2.5, 5, 1, 4, 
                        0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 2), ncol=2, byrow=T)) 
polygon = sf::st_polygon(polygon) # Create an sf polygon
points = sf::st_sample(polygon, size=50) # Sample 50 rdm pts in the polygon
# Plot using the ggplot geom_sf function.
ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(), data=polygon) + 
  geom_sf(aes(), col = alpha("black",.4), data=points) + theme_classic()
```

# Spatial simulation

- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) was used to draw the Jardin Botanique de Montréal. Buildings were added to remove them from the Jardin Botanique polygon. 
- Here, 5 random points were generated and added to the polygon

# Advanced simulations

- Now that we have the building blocks to make simulations, we are going to add another layer:
- We want to simulate a process and then see how our simulation responds to a fluctuation in a parameter
- For this, we need a certain workflow that resembles this: 
1. create a blank vector in which a value of interest will be stored in 
2. Within a loop or many `for(){}` loops, we are going to simulate data, get a desired result and store the result for future analysis 
3. Summarize our findings (in a plot, with calculations, etc.) 

.alert[ATTENTION]. This is an iterative process. Usually, we make small increments writing up the code and then put it all together in a cohesive function that will make exactly what we are looking for.

# Advanced simulations (natural selection)

- The sentence "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL" is from Shakespeare's *Hamlet*
- Richard Dawkins, in his 1986 book *The Blind Watchmaker*, used it to simulate natural selection on random genetic mutation.
