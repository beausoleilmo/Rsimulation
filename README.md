# Rsimulation

A QCBS flavored workshop on how to perform simulations in R. 

Here is the [presentation](https://beausoleilmo.github.io/Rsimulation/workshopXX-en.html#1)

All the previous QCBS R workshops give you the building block to do simulations. But knowing how to perform simulations is not a skill that is taught in the current workshops.

This workshop is designed with these learning objectives in mind: 

1. Develop intuition and skills to perform simulations;
2. Explore useful functions when designing simulations;
3. Articulate what are the assumptions underlying a simulation (for the models tested or the scope of the simulation);
4. Know how and when to use important statistical distributions;
5. Simulate different data structure to perform LMs, GLMs, and (G)LMMs. 

We will also explore: 

1. Why are simulations relevant;
2. When could a simulation be useful;
3. How to build some simulation intuitions;
4. What you need to know before doing simulations;
5. What underlies some statistical processes;
6. How to do data simulation for power analysis (in development);
7. How to do data simulation for models (lm, glm, lmm, in development);
8. How to apply simulations framework to explore any process.
